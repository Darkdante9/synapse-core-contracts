# synapse-core-contract

> **Soroban smart contract** — Phase 1 of the [Synapse Bridge](https://github.com/synapse-bridgez) ecosystem.

This contract is the **on-chain mirror** of the `synapse-core` off-chain relay service.  
It provides an auditable, idempotent transaction registry on Stellar and drives the  
three-phase lifecycle that ultimately bridges fiat deposits to cross-chain assets.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.81+ with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target  
- `stellar-cli` ≥ 22.x
- `make` (pre-installed on macOS/Linux; on Windows use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or [GNU Make for Windows](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm))

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

### First-time setup

After cloning, run the one-time setup to install the pre-commit hook:

```bash
make setup
```

This registers `.git-hooks/pre-commit` so that every commit automatically
runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy` before it is accepted locally —
the same checks CI enforces.

### Run the full check suite

```bash
make check
```

`make check` runs **fmt → clippy → test → wasm build** in order, using
exactly the same flags as the CI job. A green `make check` on your machine
means the same commit will pass CI.

| Target | Command it runs |
|---|---|
| `make fmt` | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| `make clippy` | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| `make test` | `cargo test --verbose` |
| `make wasm` | `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` |
| `make build` | `cargo build --verbose` (quick debug build) |
| `make check` | all of the above, in order |

### Build

```bash
# Debug build
make build

# Release wasm artefact
make wasm
```

### Test

```bash
make test
# or directly:
cargo test
```

### Deploy

See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** for a full deployment guide covering
initialisation, upgrade, post-deployment checklist, admin key requirements, and
monitoring setup.

### Cost estimates

See **[COST_MODEL.md](./COST_MODEL.md)** for the per-transaction XLM cost
model, including persistent and temporary storage footprints, rent fees, and
monthly budget projections at various volumes.

## Contributing

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** for branch/PR conventions, how to
run the local check suite, doc-comment expectations, and guidance on when to
write an Architecture Decision Record.

---

## Key design decisions

Non-obvious decisions are recorded as Architecture Decision Records in
[`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/). The ADR log is the canonical place to understand
*why* a design choice was made, what alternatives were considered, and what
trade-offs were accepted.

### Why relay_signer instead of direct Anchor Platform calls?

The Anchor Platform can't sign Stellar transactions directly; the off-chain  
`synapse-core` service acts as the authenticated relay. The contract trusts one  
specific `relay_signer` address whose key is held by the relay service.  
See **[ADR-0001](./docs/adr/0001-relay-signer-trust-model.md)** for the full
trust-model analysis.

### Idempotency (on-chain)

Idempotency keys are stored in **temporary** ledger storage (~24 h TTL), mirroring  
the Redis-based deduplication in the off-chain service. Duplicate `register_callback`  
calls within the window return the original `tx_id` without re-writing.

A second, durable guard also rejects any `register_callback` whose
`transaction_id` already has a stored record — regardless of idempotency-key
state — so a replay arriving after the 24h window still cannot overwrite an
existing (possibly `Completed`/`Failed`) transaction.

### Storage tiers

| Data             | Tier        | Reason                                  |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Admin / relay    | `persistent`| Must survive contract instance restore  |
| Transactions     | `persistent`| Long-lived audit record                 |
| Idempotency keys | `temporary` | Self-expiring after 24 h (≈18 000 ledgers) |
| Init flag        | `instance`  | Lives with the contract instance        |

### In-Place Contract Upgradability

**Status:** ✅ Supported

This contract includes an `upgrade(new_wasm_hash, expected_schema_version)`
entry point gated by the admin role — the `expected_schema_version` argument
must match the on-chain schema version (`schema_version()`) or the call is
rejected before touching WASM.  The full rationale, trade-off analysis, and
upgrade-boundary guarantees are documented in [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md).

**Key guarantee:** Persistent and instance storage survive a same-schema upgrade.
Only temporary storage (idempotency keys) is evicted — acceptable because their
TTL is short and the contract rejects duplicates via existing transaction records.

**Trust requirement:** The admin key **MUST** be held by a multisig (≥3-of-5) or
a DAO.  Admin-key compromise allows arbitrary WASM deployment, not just role
rotation.  See [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md#6-trust-assumptions) for the full
trust model.

**When to upgrade:**
- Bug fixes in contract logic
- Adding new read-only queries or event fields
- State-machine extensions for future phases

**When to deploy fresh:**
- Breaking changes to `Transaction` struct layout or `StorageKey` variants
- Fundamental access-control model changes
- WASM size exceeds Soroban deployment constraints

### Event schema as a stable public API

**Status:** 🔒 Locked (documented)

Once Phase 2 (Swap Engine) and Phase 3 (Cross-Chain Bridge) subscribe to this
contract’s events, topic names, payload field types/order, and multi-event
emission order are a **cross-repo API**. They do not share this repository’s
PR review or release cadence.

- **Catalogue + ordering:** [`EVENTS.md`](./EVENTS.md) — topics, `#[contracttype]`
  fields, emitting entry-points, and guaranteed order (e.g. `complete_transaction`
  emits `status` then `done`).
- **Semver:** Additive trailing fields / new events → minor or patch bump of
  `version()`. Removal, rename, reorder, type change, or emission-order change →
  **major** bump with advance notice to subscriber teams
  ([policy](./EVENTS.md#5-semver-policy)).
- **Subscriber-facing diffs:** [`CHANGELOG.md` → Event schema](./CHANGELOG.md#event-schema)
  only — separate from general code notes.

Live emitters today: `init`, `reg`, `status`, `done`, `fail`, `propose`,
`admin`, `relay`, `pause`, `upgrade` — the full catalogue in `EVENTS.md` is
wired.
